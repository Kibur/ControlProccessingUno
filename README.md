ControlProccessingUno
=====================

Controlling an Arduino Uno with Processing with server-client communication.

This contains 2 braches for the server and the client application.
There are standard pin assignments.
And it's was conceived with 8 LED's each representing a bit of one byte.

It's using the Arduino library for Processing.

Note: Only tested on Arduino Uno R3 (because I have no other)
